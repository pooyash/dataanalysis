  "description": "Blender 2.5 loves Python 3\n\nPresented by Chris Webber on October 8th, 2009\n\nChris talks about the upcoming Blender 2.5 release. \"Blender 2.5 is the\nfirst app I know of that *requires* Python 3.X. So that's pretty\ninteresting on its own. But there's plenty more interesting stuff to\ndiscuss. It's going to be mostly an overview talk. Blender's python\nintegration could possibly span 3 separate talks, especially considering\nthe blender game engine's use of it, which is a separate but interesting\ntalk.\"\n\nChiPy is a group of Chicago Python Programmers, l33t, and n00bs.\nMeetings are held monthly at various locations around Chicago. Also,\nChiPy is a proud sponsor of many Open Source and Educational efforts in\nChicago. Stay tuned to the mailing list for more info. `ChiPy\nwebsite <http://chipy.org/>`__\n",
