  "description": "Imagine you built a pretty snazzy Django app to transform your company's business. You're helping with revolutionizing the energy industry to make better use of green energy. Pretty cool right? Now imagine your company is expanding to new countries and not only that, other companies want to use your app too. Even better! But also imagine you wrote that app specifically with your company in one country in mind. This talk is going to cover the approach we've taken in transforming our app to work for multiple clients in multiple countries while still keeping the core of it the same.",
