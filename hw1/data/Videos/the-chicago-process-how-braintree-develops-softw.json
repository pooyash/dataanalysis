  "summary": "Braintree needs to be highly available and secure, while still\nmaintaining a rapid development pace and strict backwards compatibility.\nIn order to achieve that, we use what has become known as the \"Chicago\nProcess\". This involves pairing, strict TDD, a team structure, and\nweekly iterations, all to empower the devs to make decisions and get\nwork of a high quality done while avoiding siloing.\n",
