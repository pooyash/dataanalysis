  "description": "IPython and Jupyter provide tools for interactive and parallel computing\nthat are widely used in scientific computing, but can benefit any Python\ndeveloper. We will show how to use IPython in different ways, as: an\ninteractive shell, a graphical console, a network-aware VM in GUIs, a\nweb-based notebook with code, graphics and rich HTML, and a high-level\nframework for parallel computing.\n",
