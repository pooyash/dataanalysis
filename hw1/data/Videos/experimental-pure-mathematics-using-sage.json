  "description": "Pure mathematics is not always big formulas written on endless\nnotebooks, it can also be hidden behind python code. In combinatorics,\nwe study classical computer science objects like trees or graphs with a\nmathematical perspective. This talk aims to show how computer\nexploration and experimentation can be used to discover and prove new\nmathematical results.\n",
