  "description": "Real-time streams are everywhere, but does Python have a good way of\nprocessing them? Until recently, there were no good options. A new open\nsource project, streamparse, makes working with real-time data streams\neasy for Pythonistas. If you have ever wondered how to process 10,000\ndata tuples per second with Python -- while maintaining high\navailability and low latency -- this talk is for you.\n",
