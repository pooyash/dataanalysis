  "summary": "I'm not sure if we're still looking for talks on Thursday, but if so,\nI'd like to volunteer to give a talk about using Python to do some\nretro-computing hacking involving my vintage 1978 Superboard II. It's\nnot exactly robotics, but it involves hardware and a lot of low-level\nhacking (along with some Python3 and ZeroMQ thrown in for good measure\n;-).\n",
