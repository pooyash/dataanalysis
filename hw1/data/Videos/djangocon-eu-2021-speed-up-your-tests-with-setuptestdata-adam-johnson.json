  "description": "TestCase.setUpTestData allows you to create test data once per TestCase, rather than once per test. Switching tests to use setUpTestData rather than setUp can speed them up significantly, sometimes as much as 10x faster. This talk will cover how it works, its improvement in Django 3.2, and how to convert your tests to use it.",
