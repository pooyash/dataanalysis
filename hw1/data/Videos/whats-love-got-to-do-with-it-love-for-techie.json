  "summary": "What you think Love is - is (probably) wrong.\n\nThe correct metaphor / definition for live will make much more sense to\nthe software person. In fact, it will help with team building and design\ntoo. Yup.\n\nGrab a beer. I'll tell you a story about how this evolved (turing\nmachine example), how and where evolution selected it, and why it works\n- and how it works for approaching problems (design) too.\n\nThen I'll lay out the api (functional description).\n\nDon't take it too seriously. You couldn't have known. Now you will.\nCheers!\n",
