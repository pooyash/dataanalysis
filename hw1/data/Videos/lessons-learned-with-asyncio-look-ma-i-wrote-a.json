  "description": "This talk introduces the asyncio module. I'll cover what it's for, how\nit works and describe how I used it to write a real-world networked\napplication (a distributed hash table). We'll explore the event loop,\nco-routines, futures and networking with examples from my code. This\nwon't be an exhaustive exposition. Rather, attendees will grasp enough\nof asyncio to continue with their own studies.\n",
