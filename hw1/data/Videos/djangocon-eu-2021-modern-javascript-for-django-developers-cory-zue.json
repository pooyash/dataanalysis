  "description": "The talk will include four high level parts.\n\nPart 1 is a discussion of common Django / JavaScript architectures. These include:\n\n1. The most common \"ad-hoc\" approach, where JS just gets incrementally added to templates until you find yourself in a mess\n2. The \"completely decoupled\" JS front-end and Django-API back end, which is popular, but complex and unfamiliar to pure Django developers.\n3. A \"hybrid architecture\", that combines modern JS with familiarity of working in Django.\n\nPart 2 will focus on the fundamentals of JS tooling - a prerequisite to working with modern JavaScript. I'll start with explaining why it's so frustrating and confusing trying to add React to a Django project. Then introduce  the concept of a JavaScript toolchain. Why you need them and what they do. And finally do a quick overview of the most common JS toolchain: NPM, Webpack, and Babel, including what each does and the analogies in the Python world.\n\nPart 3 brings it together with a Django example, deep diving into how you can add a JS toolchain to a DJango project and introduce a React application into a Django application without all the complexity of managing separate standalone front end.\n\nPart 4 will briefly touch on some benefits of Modern JS, including using modern frameworks, dependency management, new features, extensions, ES6, React and JSX, Vue etc.",
