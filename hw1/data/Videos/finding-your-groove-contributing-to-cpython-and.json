  "description": "Do you hear a jumble of jargony noise when reading Python mailing lists?\nDo you silently edit your dotfiles and playlists to avoid asking\nquestions on IRC? Come see how Jazz can help you understand and\ncontribute to Python. While both seem vast and complex, they build on\nsimple concepts. By mixing art, knowledge, and improv, you can find your\nCPython contribution groove and enjoy cool cats' music.\n",
