  "summary": "Ben recently discovered event driven concurrency. He will be talking\nabout some of the basics as well as trying to compare it with other\nconcurrency options. The focus will be on its application in a few\nrecent projects as well as a comparison of Python's gevent and node.js.\nSome of the demos will also be using matplotlib in honor of John\nHunter's passing.\n",
