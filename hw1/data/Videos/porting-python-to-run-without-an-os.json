  "description": "We've ported Python to run directly on hardware, without an OS, as a\ntesting and exploration environment for firmware, ACPI, and UEFI. This\ntalk will explore porting Python to a new platform, embedding Python,\nrecreating enough of libc and POSIX to run Python without an OS, and\nbinding to platform-specific services. Includes live demo of bare-metal\nPython, directly driving hardware.\n",
