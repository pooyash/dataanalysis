  "description": "I developed my first CGI script in 1998. Since that day I have seen a lot of hypes coming and going.\n\nThe talk will consist of three parts:\n\n* My humorous odyssey of trying to find a great frontend framework\n* Retrospective: What do I want from the frontend?\n* I finally found: HTMX: HTML Fragments over the wire\n\nBesides simplicity, good Web Vitals performance (SEO) is a benefit of this method.\n\nThe talk will express my personal opinion, feelings and fun. It won't dive into technical details.\n\nThank you to https://www.djangsters.de for supporting the talk.\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gx1UGVAgD2ALLOucsIm9myF5mDflbP06-M6_d-RdZAY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nExample Project: https://github.com/guettli/django-htmx-fun",
