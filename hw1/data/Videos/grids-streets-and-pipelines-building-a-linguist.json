  "description": "Have you built a classifier in scikit-learn with out-of-the-box\nfeatures, been disappointed with the results, and wanted to know where\nto go next? This talk shows how to add your own feature Pipelines and\nhow to tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. We'll apply this to the\nproblem of classifying streetnames in Singapore by linguistic origin,\nand turn the results into a colour-coded street map.\n",
