  "description": "Django is a great web framework for \"perfectionists with deadlines\" and provides a lot of built-in functionality when building server-side websites. However, a lot has changed on the web since its inception in 2005, and now it has become somewhat common advice for modern web applications to only use it as an API backend, if at all.\n\nHowever, there are a few Django packages that enable building a reactive website while still utilizing all of the strengths of Django. This talk will cover the benefits of this approach, a brief overview of how other programming languages are solving this same problem, and a few Django projects which can help developers build interactive websites without writing any custom JavaScript.\n\nRepository with example code, slides, and a transcript: https://github.com/adamghill/djangocon-eu-2021-conference-talk.",
