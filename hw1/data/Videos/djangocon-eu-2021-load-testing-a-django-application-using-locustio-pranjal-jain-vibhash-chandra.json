  "description": "Fed up of using existing tools for determining benchmark and doing load testing for your server application? LocustIO is present to the rescue. LocustIO is an easy-to-use, distributed, user load testing tool. It is intended for load-testing web sites (or other systems) and figuring out how many concurrent users a system can handle.\n\nUsing Locust you will be able to determine the system performance at different endpoints in very simple and efficient way. This will provide you a rough idea on how many requests per second is supported by your application.",
