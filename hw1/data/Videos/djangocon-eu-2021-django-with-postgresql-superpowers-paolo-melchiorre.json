  "description": "Every time we\u2019re going to create a new project with **Django** we make assessments on its requirements to choose the best architecture, of which, the **database** is usually the core.\n\nDjango is a _database-agnostic_ web framework but natively supports only 4 **open source** databases: PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB and MySQL.\n\n**PostgreSQL** has the _richest feature set_ of any supported database and some of these features are natively supported directly in Django via its contrib module.\n\nIn this talk we\u2019ll see how to use to our _advantage_ the features of PostgreSQL as a database in Django, its exclusive features present in its _contrib module_ and also other **superpowers** that can be exploited through the use of _third-party packages_.\n\n--- \n\nMore info and slides: **https://www.paulox.net/2021/06/03/djangocon-europe-2021/**",
